Run-time editing for XAML pages (Win App SDK)

So far, Microsoft offers no working designers for Windows App SDK 1.0.  This may change in time, but it does not seem to be a hot issue right now.

I'm investigating enabling a developer to run an app, press a hotkey, and view/change properties of interface objects, and perhaps even code behinds.  Such changes would be made both in the running objects, and in the source code behind them.

Undecided whether to provide a single element view, a full document view (with doc outline), or both.

I don't expect anything functional soon.  Early attempts will probably focus on a few elements, like textblock, stackview, and page.
